### But let's get to the details :
On the professional front I am a Tech MBA student at Cornell Tech university living like a New Yorker ( I think I dreamed FRIENDS into life for me). I was a PM in the before life and hopefully will continue to be a stronger and better PM in the after. I love problem solving and putting things together to come up with a solution. As an Indian, I have done more sudoku, scrambled words, crossword puzzles, picture puzzles which are closed loop puzzles. What I am trying to learn at Cornell Tech and every day at work is designing solutions in the face of ambiguity. Can a problem be even solved? Apart from PM I love Data Analytics and have worked quite a few years designing models and deriving insights in the Ad Tech business. 

In my personal life, I am wife to my husband for 10 years and partner for 15. We have two amazing boys aged 8 and 2.5. When I decided to take up the opportunity to pursue my MBA at Cornell Tech because I have forever wanted to have an MBA and also to start my life afresh after a very life changing COVID infection, my beautiful family supported me by moving across the ocean and settling in Seattle.

I love reading, travelling, watching FRIENDS and cracking PJs with my friends. I am considering exploring the world of gaming but let's see how that goes. On a day to day basis, I battle between my introvertness and extrovertedness and haven't had a clear winner yet.
